# v1.1

10/01/2024

Minor hardware modifications and PCB cleanup.

- Memory select jumpers now have pulldown resistors
  
  - Without the pulldowns, the 74LS32's inputs were left floating when the memory configuration jumpers were not connected. This caused only the 56k/8k memory mode to work properly
- Mounting holes have been relocated to more accessable positions
